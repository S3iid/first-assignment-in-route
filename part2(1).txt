"it is a method that works on array only and it takes function in it "
break and continue gives error in it

            forEach(checkeven)
            function checkeven(x){
            if(x%2===0)
            console,log(x)

            } 

for...of: it is a normal loop that takes the index and loop it through whatever    after the (of)
break and continue dont give error in it
example :
array=[1,2,3,4,5]
for(let i of array)
// so it will loop by index i through the array

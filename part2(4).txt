try and catch handles the error 

write the code that can make the   error in the (try) and  handle it by a message in (catch)

 the async operations : are the operations that javascript doent wait for it to end it continue 
 the excution of code until the async operation is done 
 or 
 operations that run in the background without blocking the excution of the rest of the program

 try and catch is important in async operations because it avoid the crash of the whole program 
 
 for example when use (await): if an error happens without using try and catch it will give error and program 
 crash but in the presence of  try and catch  it catches the error

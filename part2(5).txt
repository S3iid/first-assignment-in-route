type conversion : u can change as u want (explixt)
ana ele bt7km feha  
a="123"
console.log(typeof.Number(a)) //number 

coercion :  == , + , - 
it automatically changes the type 
ex : console.log("5"+5) //5
      there is alogic error here as the result should be 10 not 55 
      but here javascript changes the number to string instead of string to number
      { - , * , / } --> javascript changes string to number
in == : if there are two different types then javascript change the type and compare
